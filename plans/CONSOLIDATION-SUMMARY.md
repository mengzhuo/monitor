## Design Documents Created

### 1. selector-design.md
**Consolidates**: candidate-status.md, eliminate-new-status.md, phase6-selection-algorithm-plan.md
**Content**: Core selection algorithm architecture, constraint system, state machine design
**Focus**: "What the system is and how it works"

### 2. monitoring-design.md
**Consolidates**: monitor-limit-enforcement.md, dynamic-testing-pool-size.md, per-status-group-change-limits.md
**Content**: Monitor lifecycle, capacity management, rule execution
**Focus**: Monitor state transitions and capacity enforcement

### 3. testing-design.md
**Consolidates**: selector-testing.md, process-refactor-fail.md patterns
**Content**: Testing strategies, coverage targets, quality assurance
**Focus**: Comprehensive testing approach and debugging patterns

### 4. api-design.md
**Consolidates**: metrics-api.md
**Content**: API extensions, authentication, metrics endpoints
**Focus**: Programmatic access patterns and security

## Project Plans Created

### 5. performance-optimizations.md
**Consolidates**: process-refactor.md, bugfixes.md performance issues
**Content**: Outstanding performance work, optimization opportunities
**Focus**: "What needs to be done" for performance

### 6. architectural-improvements.md
**Consolidates**: eliminate-new-status.md, conservative-promotion-fix.md
**Content**: Major architectural changes and simplifications
**Focus**: "What needs to be done" for architecture

### 7. quality-improvements.md
**Consolidates**: selector-testing.md todos, bugfixes.md outstanding issues
**Content**: Testing improvements, bug fixes, code quality
**Focus**: "What needs to be done" for quality

## Information Processing Strategy

### Temporal Information Handled
- **Removed**: Specific commit references, implementation dates, phase tracking
- **Preserved**: Implementation lessons learned, architectural decisions
- **Archived**: Complete implementation histories for context

### Outstanding TODOs Preserved
- **Emergency override coverage gap** → quality-improvements.md
- **API endpoint implementation** → api-design.md
- **Test coverage improvements** → quality-improvements.md
- **Architectural simplification** → architectural-improvements.md

### Design Decisions Documented
- **Constraint hierarchy patterns** → selector-design.md
- **Helper function architecture** → monitoring-design.md
- **Emergency override hierarchy** → selector-design.md
- **Testing methodology** → testing-design.md

## Benefits Achieved

### Developer Experience
- **Clear Navigation**: Logical separation between design and project plans
- **Reduced Confusion**: No more temporal information mixed with architectural docs
- **Focused Documentation**: Each document has a single, clear purpose

### Project Management
- **Outstanding Work Visibility**: Clear TODO lists in project plan files
- **Implementation History**: Preserved in archive for context
- **Progress Tracking**: Easy to see what's designed vs what needs implementation

### Maintenance
- **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated repeated architectural explanations
- **Single Source of Truth**: Design decisions documented once
- **Archive Organization**: Historical context preserved but not cluttering active work

## File-by-File Disposition

### ✅ Fully Consolidated
- **candidate-status.md** → selector-design.md (architecture) + archive (implementation)
- **monitor-limit-enforcement.md** → monitoring-design.md + archive (completed)
- **dynamic-testing-pool-size.md** → monitoring-design.md + archive (completed)
- **per-status-group-change-limits.md** → monitoring-design.md + archive (completed)
- **metrics-api.md** → api-design.md
- **process-refactor.md** → performance-optimizations.md (completed work)
- **selector-testing.md** → testing-design.md + quality-improvements.md

### 🔄 Partially Consolidated
- **bugfixes.md** → quality-improvements.md (outstanding) + performance-optimizations.md (completed)
- **eliminate-new-status.md** → selector-design.md (concepts) + architectural-improvements.md (implementation)
- **conservative-promotion-fix.md** → architectural-improvements.md

### 🏛️ Archived
- **phase6-selection-algorithm-plan.md** → archive (historical reference)
- **process-refactor-fail.md** → archive (debugging session)
- **old/pending-status.md** → archive/legacy (superseded)
- **old/systemd-legacy.md** → archive/legacy (completed)

## Integration with Main Documentation

### LLM_CODING_AGENT.md Updates
- **Added new design document references**
- **Updated Recent Architecture Changes** with July 2025 improvements
- **Enhanced Common Bug Patterns** with safety variable scope creep
- **Added Helper Function Centralization** patterns

### Maintained Cross-References
- Design documents reference relevant sections in LLM_CODING_AGENT.md
- Project plans link to design documents for context
- Archive README provides migration path from old to new docs

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Improvements
- **File Count**: 14 → 7 active documents (50% reduction)
- **Focused Purpose**: Each document has single, clear scope
- **Information Findability**: Logical grouping by document type

### Qualitative Improvements
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers can focus on either design or todos
- **Better Onboarding**: Clear architectural documentation separate from project history
- **Improved Planning**: Outstanding work clearly separated and prioritized

## Future Maintenance

### Design Document Updates
- **Rarely Updated**: Only when architecture fundamentally changes
- **Focus on Timeless Patterns**: Avoid temporal references
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ensure consistency with main documentation

### Project Plan Updates
- **Regularly Updated**: As work is completed or priorities change
- **Move Completed Work**: Archive implementation details when done
- **Maintain TODO Focus**: Keep focused on "what needs to be done"

### Archive Management
- **Preserve History**: Maintain implementation context for future reference
- **No Active Updates**: Archive documents remain static
- **Periodic Review**: Ensure archive remains relevant and organized

This consolidation transforms a scattered collection of implementation plans into a well-organized documentation system that serves both current development needs and preserves institutional knowledge for the future.
