# Plans Archive

## Overview

This directory contains historical implementation plans and completed project documentation that has been archived to maintain project history while keeping the active plans directory clean and focused.

## Directory Structure

### `completed-implementations/`
Contains implementation plans that have been fully completed. These documents provide historical context and implementation details for major features that are now part of the production system.

**Archived Plans**:
- Candidate status implementation (Phase 1-10 completion)
- Monitor limit enforcement (fully implemented July 2025)
- Dynamic testing pool sizing (completed June 2025)
- Per-status-group change limits (completed June 2025)
- Process refactoring and helper extraction (completed July 2025)
- Monitor configuration management CLI (completed - kubectl-style config editor)

### `legacy/`
Contains legacy plans and approaches that have been superseded by newer implementations or architectural decisions.

**Legacy Plans**:
- `pending-status.md` - Original pending status approach (superseded by candidate status)
- `systemd-legacy.md` - EL7 systemd support plan (replaced by StateDirectory approach)

## Relationship to Active Plans

The archive maintains the historical implementation context for features documented in the current design documents:

- **selector-design.md** - Consolidates architectural decisions from candidate-status.md and related plans
- **monitoring-design.md** - Incorporates lessons learned from monitor-limit-enforcement.md and capacity management implementations
- **testing-design.md** - Builds upon selector-testing.md requirements and patterns
- **performance-optimizations.md** - Includes completed work from process-refactor.md
- **architectural-improvements.md** - References future improvements from eliminate-new-status.md

## Document Status Legend

- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Implementation finished and deployed to production
- üîÑ **PARTIALLY COMPLETED**: Major components implemented, some gaps remain
- üìã **PLANNED**: Design complete, implementation not started
- üèõÔ∏è **ARCHIVED**: Historical record, implementation superseded or obsolete

## Historical Implementation Timeline

### June 2025
- ‚úÖ **Per-Status-Group Change Limits**: Implemented separate limits for each status transition type
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Testing Pool Sizing**: Added dynamic testing target calculation based on active monitor gap
- ‚úÖ **Iterative Account Constraint Checking**: Fixed mass constraint violations for accounts at limits

### July 2025
- ‚úÖ **Monitor Limit Enforcement**: Complete implementation with Rule 1.5, working count fixes, capacity limits
- ‚úÖ **Selector Architecture Refactoring**: Helper function centralization achieving 47% code reduction
- ‚úÖ **Safety Logic Improvements**: Fixed overly aggressive emergency conditions, unified emergency override handling
- ‚úÖ **Response Selection Priority Fix**: Corrected preference for valid responses over timeouts
- ‚úÖ **Monitor Configuration Management**: kubectl-style CLI editor with JSON validation and multi-version support

### Key Architectural Achievements
- **Constraint System Maturation**: Full constraint validation with grandfathering support
- **Capacity Management**: Dynamic pool sizing with mathematical consistency
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Comprehensive emergency override system with multi-level hierarchy
- **Code Quality**: Significant complexity reduction through helper function extraction

## Access Guidelines

### When to Reference Archive
- **Historical Context**: Understanding why certain architectural decisions were made
- **Implementation Details**: Detailed implementation steps for similar future projects
- **Lessons Learned**: Avoiding previously encountered pitfalls and bugs
- **Testing Patterns**: Proven test scenarios and coverage strategies

### Maintenance Policy
- **Preservation**: Archive documents are preserved for historical reference
- **No Updates**: Archived plans are not updated with new information
- **Migration Notes**: Links to current design documents are maintained for continuity
- **Cleanup**: Periodic review to ensure archive remains relevant and organized

This archive serves as the institutional memory of the selector system's evolution, providing valuable context for future development while keeping active planning documents focused on current and future work.
