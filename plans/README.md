# NTP Monitor Implementation Plans

## Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive planning documentation for the NTP Pool monitoring system. The plans are organized into design documents (timeless architecture) and implementation plans (actionable work items).

## Quick Status Summary

### âœ… Recently Completed
- **JWT Authentication Implementation** - Superseded API key auth plan with JWT+JWKS (commits: 10e2a70, deb9a16, 304cc1c)
- **OpenTelemetry Migration** - Complete client metrics migration (commit: 9aa4d39)
- **Database Consolidation** - Migrated to common/database package (commits: 650aeb9, 393a251, c86adf2)
- **"New" Status Elimination** - Removed from schema (commit: 64416d0)
- **Performance-Based Replacement in Rule 5** - Candidates can now replace worse-performing testing monitors (commit: de5e03a)
- **Emergency Override Consistency** - Fixed candidateâ†’testing promotion gap (commit: b6515b8)
- **Helper Function Extraction** - 47% code reduction in promotion logic (commit: 6c4ae72)
- **Safety Logic Improvements** - Fixed blocking constraint demotions (commit: e04e47a)
- **Monitor Limit Enforcement** - Complete implementation with Rule 1.5 and capacity limits
- **Network Diversity Constraint** - Fixed target state evaluation (commit: 6035139)
- **Per-Status-Group Change Limits** - Implemented separate limits for each transition type
- **Dynamic Testing Pool Sizing** - Added dynamic testing target calculation

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- **Test Coverage Improvement** - From 53.6% to 80%+ target with recent safety test additions
- **Grandfathering Logic** - Non-functional implementation needs fixing

### ðŸ“‹ Ready for Implementation
- **Performance Optimizations** - Database query optimization and testing improvements
- **Quality Improvements** - Code quality initiatives and technical debt cleanup

## Document Organization

### Design Documents (Timeless Architecture)
These documents describe "what the system is and how it works":

- **[api-design.md](api-design.md)** - API patterns, authentication, and configuration management
- **[monitoring-design.md](monitoring-design.md)** - Monitor lifecycle, capacity management, and rule execution
- **[selector-design.md](selector-design.md)** - Core selection algorithm architecture and constraint system
- **[testing-design.md](testing-design.md)** - Testing strategies, coverage targets, and quality assurance

### Implementation Plans (Actionable Work)
These documents describe "what needs to be done":

- **[grandfathering-fix.md](grandfathering-fix.md)** - ðŸ”„ Active: Functional grandfathering implementation
- **[performance-optimizations.md](performance-optimizations.md)** - ðŸ“‹ TODO: Database and testing performance improvements
- **[quality-improvements.md](quality-improvements.md)** - ðŸ”„ Active: Test coverage and code quality
- **[remaining-bugs-active.md](remaining-bugs-active.md)** - ðŸ“‹ TODO: Active bug tracking (grandfathering primary remaining issue)
- **[testing-strategy-unified.md](testing-strategy-unified.md)** - ðŸ”„ Active: Unified testing approach (6% â†’ 40-50% coverage)

### Archive Structure
- **[archive/README.md](archive/README.md)** - Historical implementation context
- **[archive/completed-implementations/](archive/completed-implementations/)** - 9 completed plans with implementation details
- **[archive/releases/](archive/releases/)** - Release notes and version history
- **[archive/legacy/](archive/legacy/)** - 2 superseded approaches

## Priority Recommendations

### High Priority (Active Development)
1. **Grandfathering Logic Implementation** - Core functionality currently broken
2. **Test Coverage Improvement** - Critical safety functions need comprehensive testing
3. **Eliminate "New" Status** - Major architecture simplification ready for implementation

### Medium Priority (Next Quarter)
1. **Performance Optimizations** - Database query optimization and testing improvements
2. **Quality Improvements** - Code quality initiatives and technical debt reduction

### Low Priority (Future Work)
1. **API Design Enhancements** - Extended API functionality and metrics endpoints
2. **Advanced Testing Strategies** - Chaos testing and performance regression prevention

## Recent Architectural Achievements

### Code Quality Improvements
- **47% Code Reduction** in promotion logic through helper function extraction
- **Consistent Emergency Handling** across all promotion types
- **Mathematical Consistency** with proper working count tracking

### System Reliability
- **Emergency Recovery** from zero monitors via constraint bypass
- **Safety Logic Validation** with comprehensive test coverage
- **Constraint System Maturation** with grandfathering support framework

### Performance Optimizations
- **80% Reduction** in constraint checks through lazy evaluation
- **Dynamic Capacity Management** with real-time pool sizing
- **Optimized Rule Execution** with proper sequencing and limits

## Development Workflow

1. **Check Active Plans**: Review in-progress items in implementation plans
2. **Reference Design Docs**: Understand architecture from design documents
3. **Update Status**: Mark completed items and update progress
4. **Archive Completed Work**: Move finished implementations to archive
