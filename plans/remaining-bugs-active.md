# Active Bug Tracking for Selector Package

## Overview

This document tracks the remaining unresolved bugs in the selector package after comprehensive analysis and major fixes. Most originally identified issues were false positives or have been resolved.

**Last Updated**: After recent emergency override and testing improvements

## Current Status Summary

**Major Fixes Completed ‚úÖ**:
- **Monitor Limit Enforcement** - Added Rule 1.5, fixed working count tracking, Rule 5 capacity limits
- **Network Diversity Constraint** - Fixed target state confusion (commit: 5d16aaa)
- **Safety Variable Scope Creep** - Fixed safety variables blocking legitimate constraint cleanup
- **Mathematical Consistency** - Fixed working count tracking across all rules

**Analysis Outcome**: After thorough code review, 9 of 13 originally identified "bugs" were false positives. The codebase demonstrates good engineering practices.

## Active Bugs Requiring Fixes

### 1. **Emergency Override Coverage Gap** ‚úÖ [RESOLVED - commit: b6515b8]
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Emergency override now consistent across all promotion paths

**Location**: `selector/constraints.go:611-629` in `canPromoteToTesting`

**Previous Problem**: Emergency override only applied to testing‚Üíactive promotions, not candidate‚Üítesting promotions

**Resolution**:
- ‚úÖ Added `emergencyOverride bool` parameter to `canPromoteToTesting` function
- ‚úÖ Updated all call sites to pass emergency override status
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive test coverage for emergency scenarios
- ‚úÖ System can now recover from zero monitors by promoting candidates despite constraints

### 2. **Non-Functional Grandfathering Logic** (Medium Priority)
**Status**: üîÑ **UNRESOLVED** - Confirmed logic issue

**Location**: `selector/state.go:104-113`

**Problem**: Grandfathered and non-grandfathered violations have identical behavior
```go
if violation.Type != violationNone {
    if violation.IsGrandfathered {
        // Grandfathered violations get gradual removal
        return candidateOut
    }
    // All constraint violations trigger gradual removal
    return candidateOut  // SAME BEHAVIOR - No benefit from grandfathering
}
```

**Impact**: Grandfathering provides no actual operational benefit, misleading configuration

**Fix Options**:
1. **Different removal rate**: Grandfathered monitors get slower demotion
2. **Priority ordering**: Grandfathered monitors processed after non-grandfathered
3. **Grace period**: Grandfathered monitors get time-based delays before demotion
4. **Remove grandfathering**: If not needed operationally, simplify the logic

**Recommendation**: Investigate operational need for grandfathering before implementing solution

### 3. **Bootstrap Constraint Inconsistency** ‚úÖ [RESOLVED - with emergency override fix]
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Fixed as part of emergency override consistency

**Location**: `selector/process.go:484, 504` in bootstrap scenarios

**Previous Problem**: Bootstrap called `canPromoteToTesting` without emergency override logic

**Resolution**: Fixed automatically when emergency override consistency was implemented - bootstrap scenarios now properly apply emergency override when needed

## Fixed/Resolved Issues ‚úÖ

### Target State Confusion in Network Diversity Check
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** (commit: 5d16aaa)
- Fixed network diversity constraint to use target state instead of current state
- Prevents invalid promotions due to state confusion

### Safety Variable Scope Creep
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** via monitor limit enforcement work
- Fixed `maxRemovals = 0` blocking ALL changes instead of just active demotions
- Safety variables now properly scoped to their intended operations

### Working Count Mathematical Consistency
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** via monitor limit enforcement work
- Fixed missing `workingTestingCount++` in Rules 5 and 6
- All rules now properly update working counts after decisions

### Rule Execution Order
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** via monitor limit enforcement work
- Fixed Rule 2.5 to run after Rule 5 to see pending promotions
- Optimized rule sequence for mathematical consistency

## Verified Non-Issues (False Positives) ‚ùå

**Account Limit Logic**: Correctly handles self-exclusion and candidate counting
**Inefficient Account Limit Building**: Proper caching implemented with existence checks
**Race Condition in Account Limit Updates**: Uses proper deep copying patterns
**Missing Null Checks**: Defensive programming patterns confirmed
**Change Limit Calculation**: Bootstrap cases correctly handled with higher limits
**Redundant Constraint Checks**: Intentional for logging/metrics purposes
**Metrics Recording**: Sequential processing with Prometheus internal synchronization
**State Access Patterns**: No evidence of actual race conditions

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Emergency Override Fix ‚úÖ [COMPLETED]
- ‚úÖ Added `emergencyOverride` parameter to `canPromoteToTesting`
- ‚úÖ Implemented constraint bypass logic when emergency conditions detected
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive tests for emergency scenarios
- ‚úÖ Verified bootstrap logic works with emergency override

### Phase 2: Grandfathering Logic üìã [TODO - Medium Priority]
**Remaining Work**:
1. **Investigation**: Determine operational need for grandfathering behavior
2. **Decision**: Choose approach (enhanced grandfathering vs removal)
3. **Implementation**: Implement chosen solution
4. **Validation**: Test with production-like constraint scenarios

### Phase 3: Integration Testing üìã [TODO - Low Priority]
**Remaining Work**:
1. End-to-end testing of grandfathering fixes
2. Performance validation of changes
3. Production deployment preparation

## Testing Requirements

### Critical Test Scenarios
1. **Zero Active Monitor Recovery**: ‚úÖ Emergency override enables candidate promotion despite constraints
2. **Grandfathering Behavior**: üìã TODO - Validate different treatment of grandfathered vs new violations
3. **Bootstrap with Constraints**: ‚úÖ System recovery when all candidates have constraint violations
4. **Emergency + Grandfathering**: üìã TODO - Interaction between emergency override and grandfathered violations

### Performance Tests
1. **No Regression**: Verify fixes don't slow down normal operations
2. **Emergency Performance**: Ensure emergency scenarios complete quickly
3. **Constraint Checking**: Validate constraint logic performance unchanged

## Development Notes

### Emergency Override Pattern
```go
// Recommended implementation pattern
func (sl *Selector) canPromoteToTesting(
    monitor *monitorCandidate,
    server *serverInfo,
    accountLimits map[uint32]*accountLimit,
    existingMonitors []ntpdb.GetMonitorPriorityRow,
    emergencyOverride bool, // ADD THIS PARAMETER
) bool {
    // Check constraints normally
    if violation := sl.checkConstraints(monitor, server, accountLimits, existingMonitors); violation != nil {
        if emergencyOverride {
            // Log emergency bypass
            sl.logger.WarnContext(ctx, "emergency override: promoting despite constraint violation",
                "monitor", monitor.ID, "violation", violation.Type)
            return true
        }
        return false
    }
    return true
}
```

### Grandfathering Enhancement Options
```go
// Option 1: Time-based grace period
if violation.IsGrandfathered {
    gracePeriod := time.Since(violation.Since)
    if gracePeriod < time.Hour * 24 {
        return candidatePending // Delay demotion
    }
    return candidateOut // Gradual removal after grace period
}

// Option 2: Priority-based processing
if violation.IsGrandfathered {
    return candidateOut // Lower priority for removal
} else {
    return candidateBlock // Higher priority for removal
}
```

## Success Criteria

### Bug Resolution Validation
- [x] Emergency scenarios with zero monitors recover successfully
- [ ] Grandfathering provides measurable operational benefit
- [x] Bootstrap scenarios work regardless of constraint violations
- [x] No performance regression in normal operations

### Code Quality Improvements
